Assumptions: 
1> On selection of option a modal pop-
   up should appear containing order details of Restaurant.
   
   For the above case, I was not sure of what does it mean by "order details of Restaurant".
   Initally, I thought it is the menu-list. But the "menu_url" parameter returned by the zomato api is a link to zomato page.
   
  Therefore, I have used an image returned by the API there.  


2> There is much more work pending in the css part. Unfortunately, I was not able to fix the css within the stipulated time.

3> There is also a scope of scope refactoring at some places.

4> Unfortunately, I have not implemented the "Provide filter and sort options based on rating" because if the time constraints.
